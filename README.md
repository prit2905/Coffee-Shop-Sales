This Coffee Shop Dashboard project aimed to revolutionize operational strategy through comprehensive data analysis and visualization. By leveraging transactional data spanning from January to June 2023, this project endeavored to provide invaluable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends across three locations Astoria , Hell's kitchen and Lower monhattan.
# Key Objectives :
* Data Preparation and Profiling: The initial phase involved meticulous data cleansing and profiling to ensure accuracy and reliability. Calculated fields such as revenue, month, day of the week, and hour of the day
  were added to facilitate in-depth analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis with Pivot Tables: Excel PivotTables were employed to dissect the dataset and uncover meaningful patterns. Views were created to analyze revenue trends over months, transactions by day of   the week and hour of the day, and transaction volumes by product category and type.
* Dynamic Dashboard Development: The culmination of the project was the development of an interactive dashboard that provided stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to explore and interpret the data. Pivot        charts were strategically integrated to visualize revenue trends, transaction volumes, and product performance. A dynamic slicer enabled seamless filtering by store location, allowing for targeted analysis and       decision-making.
